"One of the main obstacles to learn a computer language is learning the things not germane to learning the language. Ch is as close to a perfect teaching environment as I have seen in 20 years for teaching C or C++. I advocate Ch to all of my CS students. If I were in charge of the world, I would require all schools to use an interactive environment such as Ch."

--- Professor Gene Sheppard, Computer Science, Georgia Perimeter College

"Ch is the first implementation, portable to different platforms, of major new features of complex numbers, variable length arrays (VLAs), and IEEE floating-point arithmetic added in C99.
I have to mention how impressed I am with both the quality of Ch and how complete the environment is. I had recently ported code written over years in C shell, Perl, and Python to Ch. The porting was very simple and straightforward."

--- Tom MacDonald, the former Chair of the ANSI C Standard Committee
