C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of the C language include low-level memory access, a simple set of keywords, and a clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development. 
Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Few programs may compile in C, but not in C++). 
Beginning with C programming: 
 

    Structure of a C program 
    After the above discussion, we can formally assess the structure of a C program. By structure, it is meant that any program can be written in this structure only. Writing a C program in any other structure will hence lead to a Compilation Error.
    The structure of a C program is as follows:
     

    The components of the above structure are: 
        Header Files Inclusion: The first and foremost component is the inclusion of the Header files in a C program. 
        A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files.
        Some of C Header files: 
            stddef.h – Defines several useful types and macros.
            stdint.h – Defines exact width integer types.
            stdio.h – Defines core input and output functions
            stdlib.h – Defines numeric conversion functions, pseudo-random network generator, memory allocation
