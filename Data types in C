Also known as ‘automatic type conversion’.

    Done by the compiler on its own, without any external trigger from the user.
    Generally takes place when in an expression more than one data type is present. In such condition type conversion (type promotion) takes place to avoid loss of data.
    All the data types of the variables are upgraded to the data type of the variable with largest data type.

        
           bool -> char -> short int -> int -> 
           unsigned int -> long -> unsigned -> 
           long long -> float -> double -> long double

    It is possible for implicit conversions to lose information, signs can be lost (when signed is implicitly converted to unsigned), and overflow can occur (when long long is implicitly converted to float).
